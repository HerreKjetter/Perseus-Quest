# Perseus-Quest
In this text based adventure, you play as the mythological character Perseus. You are on a quest to find the weapon that will kill the gorgon, Medusa.
At the current moment, I would like to make the game responsive across browsers and fix the "cutscenes". Artwork will be coming soon, in the mean time just use public domain photos.
