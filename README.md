# Perseus-Quest
In this text based adventure, you play as the mythological character Perseus. You are on a quest to find the weapon that will kill the gorgon, Medusa.
At the current moment, I would like to expand the world the player travels in and add new objectives. Along with making the game accessible and responsive across desktop and mobile browsers. Artwork will be coming soon, in the mean time just use public domain photos.
