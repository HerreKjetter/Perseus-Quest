# Perseus-Quest
In this text based adventure, you play as the mythological character Perseus. You are on a quest to find the weapon that will kill the gorgon, Medusa.
At the current moment, I would like to make the game responsive across browsers. Artwork will be coming soon, in the mean time just use public domain photos.

Install Instructions:
Click on the green Code button.
Select Download Zip and the game will start downloading.
Once the Zip file has finished downloading open it and go to the src folder.
In the src double-click the scene1.html file and will open in your default web browser.
Enjoy the game.
