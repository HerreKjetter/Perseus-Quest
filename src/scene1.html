        <h1>Your story begins...</h1>
        <p>Acrisius, King of Argos, is given a daughter, named Danaë, despite hoping for a son. He visits the Oracle at Delphi, who warns him that he would one day be killed by his grandson.
            Acrisius imprisons his daughter in a bronze chamber. Zeus visits her and fathers her a child named Perseus. This is who you are. Enraged, Acrisius casts you and Danaë into the sea in a wooden chest.
            You and Danaë wash ashore on the island of Seriphos where you're rescued by a fisherman named Dictys who is the brother of Polydectes, the king of the island. You are raised by Dictys. 
            Polydectes falls in love with your mother and holds a large banquet where each guest is expected to bring a gift. You are invited to this banquet, but have nothing to give. You ask Polydectes to name his
            gift.</p>
        <p>He demands the head of a gorgon named Medusa.</p>
