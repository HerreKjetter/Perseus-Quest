        <p>From here you proceeded to visit King Atlas, but he refuses you hospitality. In revenge you turn him to stone by showing him the severed head of Medusa.</p>
        <p>On the way back to Seriphos, you stop in the kingdom of Aethiopia ruled by King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia.</p>
        <p>Queen Cassiopeia has boasted of her daughter Andromeda beauty as being equal to the Nereids. This has angered Poseidon who has sent a Cetus to terrorize the kingdom.</p>
